# Ender's Netrunning Loadout Generator

Consists of 2 parts, `bizon` and `cobra`, both needed to complete the loadout.

## Installation

On a new boot of Kali Linux, run the following:

`export GIT_EMAIL=<emailhere>`

`sudo ./install_bizon.sh`

`./install_cobra.sh`

Bizon is the part of the install that needs sudo permissions to work. Cobra is the part that requires no special permissions.
